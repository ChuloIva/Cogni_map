"And I don't think it’s directly related to his death because we had been separated for about four years before he was killed. And I, I became aware that, after he died especially, that he was really very important in my life. I was kind of using him as a shield against going out and having other relationships. And now he’s gone and I can't use that anymore. And I feel very, very frightened of new male relationships."

"Yes. For a long time I didn't feel like going out and that was fine. I was going through my loss of him, but that was all right. I didn’t push it or anything. But just recently I started going out and I've been aware for years of how lonely, I have been very, very lonely. I haven't been dating very much for the last four years, mostly just working and taking care of the kids. And um, I think I'm keeping myself in kind of a no-win situation where I'm really lonely. And yet it's kind of like I'm keeping myself there because I've got a guard around me, and I'd kind of like to break out of that."

"That's right. That's why, that's why I value the friendships with men and with other people. I don't care for the rest. Not to say that I don't need it, I do, but I need the friendship, and the safety and the security of that first. I, um, took a trip not too long ago and I met a man that I had known years and years ago, only very briefly. And I met him again I went out with him. And he was such a lovely person, such a kind person, and a very ... a very good person. Anyway, it was in the mountains and as I was driving home from his, um, his home, looking at the mountains, I, I had this feeling. It’s kind of funny, I haven't read the Carlos Castaneda books, but I know the concept of the third eye. And I was feeling as I was driving through those mountains that, “Now it’s all right for my third eye to come out, and to be able to perceive.” And I felt so good. But when I came back home, I've kind of busied myself with woodworking, and the house, and that kind of thing. And I'm kind of back in the same environment, in the same predicament. But I know that I, I consciously at times choose between focusing in on things and not."

"I want to make a joke and say, "Aw, go on." You know, um, I'm a nurse and, a psychiatric nurse, worked in a psychiatric hospital last year. One of the big things there, the patients got a lot of points if they would talk in group. I mean everybody wants you to talk. You know, the good patient talks. And I thought, you know, anybody can talk. The reason why people don’t talk is not because they can’t talk, it’s because they don't know how people are going to respond. That's where it’s at. So I don’t think the patients were not being good patients. I don't think they were being bad patients because they weren't talking. I think that the staff should have a demerit for not responding. Ok, these patients talked, now how do you respond? Makes it a whole new ballgame."

"That's it, not to someone who’ll say, "Oh, well, Kathy, I really care," and then I don't see them for a couple of years. Or, "I'll call you" and then they never call. You know, when I first split up from my husband, I would go to these different functions, not with a date, but with friends, and meet a man and he'd say, "I'll call you". And for a while there I'd be sure that I wasn't home, because I couldn't stand to know if he didn't call. And that way I didn't know if he didn't call, so there was a possibility that he had called. But I wasn't home, so how could I know. So with that, that, that vulnerable I was really in touch with it."

"That's right; I had a dream one time. And I dreamed that I was on a sled with two other girls, and we were going down a snowy hill. And we were going too fast. And I told them to stop, they had to get off, otherwise they were going to crash into this train station at the bottom of the hill. And they wouldn't believe me. So I got off, and they went on. And I side-stepped in the snow all the way down the hill, but there were lots of trees where I was side stepping, and I was hanging onto the trees, one by one as I went down. And when I got to the bottom of the hill, the sled had crashed, or something. And then I thought to myself, “That means, that has to do with me. Part of me would go too fast, and…”"

"Maybe that's a good stopping point. END Rogers’ Post-Session Commentary I found it fascinating, the way in which this client very slowly lowers her defenses. I think those defenses could be broken through, but that in my estimation would not be as helpful as letting her proceed at her own pace. I think the client learns more that way. We did progress in the interview. We went from her perception of loneliness as her problem, to her fear of her relationships with men, to her feelings about letting the tender, vulnerable part of herself come out of a cave, to the recognition of the little girl in her that wants to be tenderly let out. She then began to get to the recognition of the deep, of the pain that is deep inside of her. That is unspeakable, almost unbearable. We saw her partially experience that pain, in spots, and then draw back. Then finally we saw the feelings that she has, that perhaps at bottom she is completely unlovable, one of the commonest feelings that people have. I thought that the dream at the end was almost a perfect description of the hour. She went deeper into herself, step-by-step, by slow degrees, cautiously and guardedly because she didn’t want to crash into that pain. And she took resting times between the steps. So I thought that described the whole progress of the hour. I feel that it was a working interview, not highly dramatic, and much of therapy is work, and this was a good example of it. I felt present to her. I felt a companion in her exploration. If I were to continue to see her I think that she would gradua1ly move toward experiencing that care of herself of which she is quite frightened. I like the way we got into metaphors. Clients can say more in metaphors then they can say, than they dare to say openly. And I like the way I responded to the metaphors. I liked the way she was able to express her anger toward me whenever she felt it, whenever she felt that she was close to a dangerous part of her experiencing a painful part of her experiencing and that was easy for me to accept that anger. I felt good about this as a first interview."

"I don't know. I was sitting in the room and waiting, before, and I was thinking about when I was about 7 or 8 years old. I remember reading a book, I believe. And I can't recall the name, by Jung, I think it was. I recalled that when I was reading it, at that time, I used to go down in the basement of my home and um, turn off all the lights. And in a way, that was kind of closing the outside world out and concentrating on what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be. And at 7 years old I was into that, and today I'm in the same position . . . um, really at this, you know, trying to find out what I want to do, what I want to be.

"I think that I've listened for so long to other people about who I was and I remember in 2nd grade I was a potential credit to my race. That was one of the . . . I used to wonder why I couldn't be a credit to somebody else's race also. I think I was really conditioned to be something. To be some kind of a symbol, or whatever, and not really being a person, you know, I kind of missed out on my childhood to an extent. I don't really regret it. I don't think I regret it anyway, but I've really been through a lot of changes. And I think that now, after finding out I had leukemia and after dealing with the leukemia in the way I did, it's just really incredible, you see.

"Oh, yeah. For sure. For sure. On one hand I accepted the death. I, you know, at my young age I think I've lived long and a great deal.

"Oh, yeah. But I proceeded very meticulously to carry out a plan, where my children would live in an area that I wanted them to live. And that, I was trying to control something after I died. Only when I went back this year in March to celebrate my children's birthday, and I had four weeks, incidentally, to live at that time; I was told on March 15 that I had four weeks to live. And it was really incredible because like, for the first time, I saw all my relatives and my friends. And they were coming in and they were very loving, very loving people, and very kind, you see. Um, but at the same time, they were all throwing flowers on my grave. And I don't think they knew that. And as a result, I got worse and I got worse, and um, I took a friend back. You see, I'd lived out here in California. um, after I found out that I had leukemia, I proceeded to develop a plan to move my family out here. And we moved out in approximately November after several trips out in the area. The trips were basically to find a doctor and also find in a way some kind of a hope. You see, I have this conditioned thing about being a fighter. So, on one hand I accept that, and on the other hand I was trying to do all I damned well could to live."

And there were a lot of things that I did that I am not really very pleased about. But you know, after thinking about it for just a little while, or whatever, one of the things I miss you know, I guess maybe from not telling people or whatever, about I was ill . . . but uh, after I told them, some months later, when I had four weeks to live, I didn’t find anybody that allowed me to be desperate, that could understand some of the things that I didn't want to do.

There wasn't very much of a connection between, between all of that love and whatever that I put in, and then all of a sudden you know, I became just another uh, you know, I became just another black person. I became just another nigger. You know, and I think it's important to understand that my wife is you know, is white, German Irish. And I think that's a part of that whole thing. Um, when we first married, you know, my father-in-law, we just fought tooth and nail, but then after that we loved each other . . . for about six long, good, hard years. And basically, he was my only connection and when he died . . . I found that there was no support. There was absolutely no support."

"Oh, no. Not at - I really, I really had a fear of that. You know? I really, I guess, didn't trust some things that were happening, um, gee, at a whole global level, you know. But to, then to entrust that kind of information to other people. I was very uneasy about that. Very uneasy about that. And I did a lot of things that I didn't, didn't really want to do because I was very desperate. Um, I gave up my, my job and came out here, and I did consultant work and so forth, but I had to use a great deal of money for diagnosticians or whatever and, and, and all kinds of little gimmicks to keep me alive. And consequently I had to borrow money. And when I borrowed that money, I didn't borrow it in a way that would say to you like, "Hey, uh, Ted or whatever, I need, you know X amount of dollars, you know, and like . . . 'cause I've got, I have leukemia," and so forth. I'm scared to death to say that, you know? You know, I needed some money because of uh, I think I must have invented about ten stories, you know. And I think about it and you know, like, I felt real bad about that, you know. And uh, because like I had developed a professional uh, attitude I think, about myself, or at least a kind of . . . I had a lot of respect from a lot of people. And you know, I really did have that . . . I don’t know if that was love or caring or whatever, but it was respect. When I got involved with money, the situation with money, I had to borrow money and I really couldn't tell. And in a way, you know, I really wanted to tell, but I hadn't even told my wife and my family. And I said, okay, well one thing, you know, and I'm gonna, I'm going to be okay, and this money is going to be here, and everything else like that and I think that's a part of, uh, me that I really, I'm not really sure, that ah, you know, is really acceptable you know, because I have to be perfect."

"Absolutely. Even when I needed money or whatever, I didn't need money because of my health. It was because of maybe bad business experience or an investment, or something or other . . . and like, for the people who trusted that kind of information or whatever . . . like I, you know, well, I'm going to deal with that. I'm going to deal with that. But that's not in my character, it's never been in my character. I had to keep that image. I had to keep the image. And uh, it cost me my family, a couple children, you know. I guess that was the most important thing that it cost me. I think the other things are really not that important. But, but what it did do, what the leukemia did do . . . it helped me to, to understand that I'm just an ordinary human being like everybody else. You know, and sometimes you know, like, everybody has problems, and so forth, but at the same time it was like, it was my character to do that. You know, I wouldn't tell them. No. For what?"

"I think, I think it did. I think it did. Finally, at the end it did. I use the end . . . the four weeks when I was told I had four weeks to live that was the end, at the end of the leukemia. Even though I'm in remission now, I don't plan to, I don't . . . you see, I haven't told you that I went to, I went for the tests and gave enormous amounts of blood. I don't know where they were sending that blood or what they were doing with it. I gave an extraordinary amount, but nothing, nothing was coming of that. But you know, one of the things I did know that if I went to the hospital, if I did what the doctors said, I'd probably die. And it's almost like, you know, when you first become an agnostic in school, or whatever, you know, you go through . . . like I went through all this religious training, whatever. . . and I said, "I don't think that there's a God." Or, "that isn't really important, or whatever." But then at the same time, I hold back, you know. And every now and then I give an occasional prayer just in case."

For me, that was extremely radical, but it was fun you know, and it was one of the first fun things that I did. Since I was ill, you know, because on top of having the leukemia I was fighting a divorce and having my property ripped away from me, you know, and having married into a family, and a family that was a different race than I was, and I learned later, as my wife told me that she didn't know that a whole community wanted to divorce. Like they were married. And I was hurt by that too. You know, how very good, Christian, upstanding people can make some pretty serious judgments without knowing you know, the whole story."

"In getting all those bad things out, I'm not sure in terms of how to deal yet, or whatever. And I'm really not sure.

Because they're still, you know, when I talk to my wife from 3,000 miles away and she tells me about what her mother thinks and all sorts of other things, or whatever, I get sick. It happened yeah . . . it happened the other day. She called and everything was really great and then she'd begin to talk about a lot of other people, and what their attitudes and what their opinions was. That night I got very little sleep and was ready to go back to the hospital and was ready to have leukemia too. I was ready. You know?"

And I was staying at my wife's house where we were going, keep in mind now, we were going through a divorce, the whole bit, and were, uh celebrating my children's birthday at the same time. My mother calls. "We're coming over." Nobody at the house. All of a sudden I lose my . . . my vision goes. You know, that was one of the symptoms of leukemia.

"When I'm positive and when I’m doing things that I enjoy, I don't have symptoms anymore. I don't have symptoms. And I don't you know, like, when I came down here, the doctors wanted me to have transfusions and things like that, you know, and I remember one doctor saying to me, "I don't know really who's got you into playing this tennis and all that, or whatever, but you really need to come in here and have a transfusion." I said, "For what? I'm doing okay." "To be on the safe side." You know? That's . . . well, I won't say what that is. But, you know, like, to some extent though, that confirms some things to me about not trusting doctors to take care of myself. I'm talking about the leukemia. I'm certainly not trying to indict all doctors or the medical profession by what happened to me, you know, I think, I hope, in some way that other people who have life-threatening illnesses can deal with it because I think I have, and I do have that control. And like, since I was 7, to some extent, when I went down in that basement and turned that light off, or whatever, and I shut the outside world off . . . or whatever, somehow I've lost that . . . because somehow in the process of becoming educated and socialized, and whatever, I let other people control what I wanted and what I wanted to do. And I really . . . I did. That was a . . . Jesus, that was a, yeah, well, okay."

We have the standards for you. Live up to our expectations. You've got to be the image. You've got to be just right. And everything."

"Not at all. Not at all. There was enough to do without worrying about your own little problems and things like that at that time, so I said to myself then, you know? Oh, yeah. A lot of things are racing through my mind as we talk and, but there are certain things that go through this whole thing that I pick out in terms of when I was seven, and those are just really important times for me, you know. They were important times in terms of when I was alone, and when I was sure, and when I felt good and I felt a part of the you know, the stars, the universe. I really did feel that. You know, I remember I used to go out when I was 7, 8, 9 years old . . . three or four o'clock in the morning, look up in that beautiful sky and see those stars or whatever, and I'd say, "That's mine over there and I'm going to be there." And I felt good. I felt I don't know, in a sense integrated, more integrated than after . . . and as I continued to do this and fill out the forms for a scholarship, or things like that, I lost it. I really lost it."

But I saw him when he was hurt too, and um when he was killed in, in 1975, in a, in a hunting accident, it just really took all of it, you know. Because you see, he helped me to, to try to get out of that stuff. He's saying, "Hey, what are you doing, you know? Do ... what do you really want to do?". And at the time I wanted to, you know, to open my own restaurant or whatever. And so he was going to help me finance that restaurant, you know. And so a week later he was killed. One week. And um, and so we were getting so close, but that I really never told him that, "Hey Dad, you know, hey Dad, I love you, I really love you". And we told each other, I guess, in some ways or whatever, but it's not the same as saying it, you know, as saying, "Dad, I really love you. I really care"."

"Right. And I'm not so sure that that, that I want that, it to work like that again, you know.

Maybe that would be a start or whatever, but I just don't really trust that they really understand that. I don't really, really uh ... it took my wife who lived with me for seven years, you know, after I left, maybe six, seven months to understand that I was, that I was hurt, that I was ... that I was desperate."
