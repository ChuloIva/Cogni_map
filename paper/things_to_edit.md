Remove the optimised single pass activation thing, form everywhere that is nothing new or to be a proud of or contribution, thats very normal

frame it all as a tool to explore/ anntotate cognitive actions tracking what cognitvie actions are activating while the model is generating text and can be used for various downstream tasks, we are presenting the tool, and showing some of the tasks like exploring what cognitve actions activate in therapy sessions, it can be used for quantitave and qualitative analysis as we are also including TUI for qualitative analysis

we have trained the probes of all layers of gemma 3 4b and we are offering full probe performance across all layers 

also add how we augumented the texts for sentiment probes

we trained on 31500 examples 700 per example of a cognitive action and 1800 for sentiment 900 per postive/negative sentiment 

make sure that the details of hidden dim for that model are correct, and that the number of layers is correct.

look online for any information that you may needg
